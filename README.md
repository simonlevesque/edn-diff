# edn-diff

A edn diff library for Clojure.

edn-diff currently only supports diffing s-exp and does not preserve forms like vectors or maps (coming soon).

the s-exp differ is clojure port from Michael Weber's Common Lisp implementation and Vincent St-Amour, Felix Winkelmann scheme implementations of SEXP-DIFF.

## Usage

### end-diff.core

The main namespace for edn diff operations in the `edn-diff` library is `edn-diff.core`.

``` clj
(require '[edn-diff.core :as diff])
```
#### diff a s-exp

``` clj
(diff/sexp-diff '(+ 1 (- 1 2 3) (* (+ 1 2) 3))
                '(+ 1 (- 1 2 4) (* 3 3)))
=> ((+ 1 (- 1 2 :old 3 :new 4) (* :old (+ 1 2) :new 3 3)))
```

## Roadmap
